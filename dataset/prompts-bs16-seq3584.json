were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank\u2060\u2014the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am older than you, and must know better\u201d; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\u2019ll soon make you dry enough!\u201d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n\n\u201cAhem!\u201d said the Mouse with an important air, \u201care you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \u2018William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh!\u201d said the Lory, with a shiver.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u201cDid you speak?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot I!\u201d said the Lory hastily.\n\n\u201cI thought you did,\u201d said the Mouse. \u201c\u2060\u2014I proceed. \u2018Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\u201cFound what?\u201d said the Duck.\n\n\u201cFound it,\u201d the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u201cof course you know what \u2018it\u2019 means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what \u2018it\u2019 means well enough, when I find a thing,\u201d said the Duck: \u201cit\u2019s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\u201d\n\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u201c\u200a\u2018\u2060\u2014found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William\u2019s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans\u2060\u2014\u2019 How are you getting on now, my dear?\u201d it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.\n\n\u201cAs wet as ever,\u201d said Alice in a melancholy tone: \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to dry me at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u201cI move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies\u2060\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak English!\u201d said the Eaglet. \u201cI don\u2019t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t believe you do either!\u201d And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.\n\n\u201cWhat I was going to say,\u201d said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u201cwas, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a Caucus-race?\u201d said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said the Dodo, \u201cthe best way to explain it is to do it.\u201d (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n\nFirst it marked out a racecourse, in a sort of circle, (\u201cthe exact shape doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and away,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, \u201ceverybody has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\n\u201cWhy, she, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \u201cPrizes! Prizes!\u201d\n\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one apiece all round.\n\n\u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201cWhat else have you got in your pocket?\u201d he went on, turning to Alice.\n\n\u201cOnly a thimble,\u201d said Alice sadly.\n\n\u201cHand it over here,\u201d said the Dodo.\n\nAlice accepts a humble handed to her by a dodo who is taller than herself. The dodo leans upon a stick.\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble\u201d; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\n\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.\n\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\n\u201cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand why it is you hate\u2060\u2014C and D,\u201d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.\n\n\u201cMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.\n\n\u201cIt is a long tail, certainly,\u201d said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail; \u201cbut why do you call it sad?\u201d And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u2060\u2014\n\n\u201cFury said to\na mouse, That\nhe met\nin the\nhouse,\n\u2018Let us\nboth go\nto law:\nI will\nprosecute\nyou\u2060\u2014\nCome, I\u2019ll\ntake no\ndenial;\nWe must\nhave a\ntrial:\nFor\nreally\nthis\nmorning\nI\u2019ve\nnothing\nto do.\u2019\nSaid the\nmouse to\nthe cur,\n\u2018Such a\ntrial,\ndear Sir,\nWith no\njury or\njudge,\nwould be\nwasting\nour breath.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll be\njudge,\nI\u2019ll be\njury,\u2019\nSaid\ncunning\nold Fury:\n\u2018I\u2019ll try\nthe whole\ncause,\nand\ncondemn\nyou\nto\ndeath.\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\u201cYou are not attending!\u201d said the Mouse to Alice severely. \u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Alice very humbly: \u201cyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had not!\u201d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\n\u201cA knot!\u201d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. \u201cOh, do let me help to undo it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall do nothing of the sort,\u201d said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \u201cYou insult me by talking such nonsense!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice. \u201cBut you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u201d\n\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\n\n\u201cPlease come back and finish your story!\u201d Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \u201cYes, please do!\u201d but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n\n\u201cWhat a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u201d sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u201cAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, Ma!\u201d said the young Crab, a little snappishly. \u201cYou\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u201d said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. \u201cShe\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u201d said the Lory.\n\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u201cDinah\u2019s our cat. And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u201d\n\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \u201cI really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u201d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \u201cCome away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\u201d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\n\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u201d she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u201cNobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u201d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.",

Goodbye, feet!\u201d (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). \u201cOh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m sure I shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2060\u2014but I must be kind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\u201d\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201cThey must go by the carrier,\u201d she thought; \u201cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending presents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\nAlice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq.\nHearthrug,\nNear the Fender,\n(With Alice\u2019s Love).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like you,\u201d (she might well say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u201d But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\n\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of anyone; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please, sir\u2060\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice kneels in a low corridor, watching a white rabbit hurry away.\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear! How queer everything is today! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that\u2019s the great puzzle!\u201d And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u201d she said, \u201cfor her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she\u2019s she, and I\u2019m I, and\u2060\u2014oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2060\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t signify: let\u2019s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome\u2060\u2014no, that\u2019s all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u2018How doth the little\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:\u2060\u2014\n\n\u201cHow doth the little crocodile\nImprove his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\nOn every golden scale!\n\n\u201cHow cheerfully he seems to grin,\nHow neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\nWith gently smiling jaws!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u201d said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \u201cI must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve made up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019 I shall only look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down here till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019\u2060\u2014but, oh dear!\u201d cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \u201cI do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!\u201d\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking. \u201cHow can I have done that?\u201d she thought. \u201cI must be growing small again.\u201d She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n\u201cThat was a narrow escape!\u201d said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u201cand now for the garden!\u201d and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \u201cand things are worse than ever,\u201d thought the poor child, \u201cfor I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u201d\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \u201cand in that case I can go back by railway,\u201d she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\n\nAlice is swept off her feet by a flood of water which reaches over her shoulders.\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201d said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. \u201cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer today.\u201d\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\n\n\u201cWould it be of any use, now,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cto speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201d So she began: \u201cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201d (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201cA mouse\u2060\u2014of a mouse\u2060\u2014to a mouse\u2060\u2014a mouse\u2060\u2014O mouse!\u201d The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI daresay it\u2019s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201d (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \u201cOu est ma chatte?\u201d which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201cI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot like cats!\u201d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201cWould you like cats if you were me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps not,\u201d said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201cdon\u2019t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,\u201d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \u201cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face\u2060\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse\u2060\u2014and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice\u2060\u2014oh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk about her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe indeed!\u201d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. \u201cAs if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u2019t let me hear the name again!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t indeed!\u201d said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \u201cAre you\u2060\u2014are you fond\u2060\u2014of\u2060\u2014of dogs?\u201d The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \u201cThere is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things\u2060\u2014I can\u2019t remember half of them\u2060\u2014and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and\u2060\u2014oh dear!\u201d cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u201d For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\n\nAlice is swimming in a pool watching a mouse as big as herself swim away.\nSo she called softly after it, \u201cMouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u201d When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u201cLet us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u201d\n\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",

was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice \u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u201cOrange Marmalade,\u201d but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! \u201cI wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\u2060\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201c\u2060\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2060\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2060\u2014\u201d (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u201c\u2060\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2060\u2014fancy curtseying as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201cAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much tonight, I should think!\u201d (Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at teatime. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201cDrink Me\u201d beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n\nIt was all very well to say \u201cDrink me,\u201d but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll look first,\u201d she said, \u201cand see whether it\u2019s marked \u2018poison\u2019 or not\u201d; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \u201cpoison,\u201d it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was not marked \u201cpoison,\u201d so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n\n\u201cWhat a curious feeling!\u201d said Alice; \u201cI must be shutting up like a telescope.\u201d\n\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u201cfor it might end, you know,\u201d said Alice to herself, \u201cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u201d And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n\n\u201cCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201d said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u201cI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201d She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u201cBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cto pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!\u201d\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u201cEat Me\u201d were beautifully marked in currants. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201d\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201cWhich way? Which way?\u201d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",

Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, \u201cI\u2060\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2060\u2014at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said the Caterpillar sternly. \u201cExplain yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain myself, I\u2019m afraid, sir,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not myself, you see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u201d Alice replied very politely, \u201cfor I can\u2019t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u201d said Alice; \u201cbut when you have to turn into a chrysalis\u2060\u2014you will some day, you know\u2060\u2014and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little queer, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u201d said Alice; \u201call I know is, it would feel very queer to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u201cI think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\n\n\u201cCome back!\u201d the Caterpillar called after her. \u201cI\u2019ve something important to say!\u201d\n\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n\n\u201cKeep your temper,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \u201cSo you think you\u2019re changed, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I am, sir,\u201d said Alice; \u201cI can\u2019t remember things as I used\u2060\u2014and I don\u2019t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t remember what things?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve tried to say \u2018How doth the little busy bee,\u2019 but it all came different!\u201d Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n\n\u201cRepeat, \u2018you are old, Father William,\u2019\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice folded her hands, and began:\u2060\u2014\n\nA young man in rural costume stares at an old fat man who is standing on his head.\n\u201cYou are old, Father William,\u201d the young man said,\n\u201cAnd your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2060\u2014\nDo you think, at your age, it is right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d Father William replied to his son,\n\u201cI feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I\u2019m perfectly sure I have none,\nWhy, I do it again and again.\u201d\n\nA young man in rural costume backs away from a doorway as an old fat man somersaults through it.\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cas I mentioned before,\nand have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door\u2060\u2014\nPray, what is the reason of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n\u201cI kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment\u2060\u2014one shilling the box\u2060\u2014\nAllow me to sell you a couple?\u201d\n\nA young man in rural costume lifts the covers from a empty plates and stares at a fat old man sitting by a fireplace.\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cand your jaws are too weak\nFor anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2060\u2014\nPray how did you manage to do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d said his father, \u201cI took to the law,\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\nHas lasted the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nA young man in rural costume stares in amazement at an old fat man who is balancing a wriggling eel on his nose.\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cone would hardly suppose\nThat your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2060\u2014\nWhat made you so awfully clever?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\u201d\nSaid his father; \u201cdon\u2019t give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\nBe off, or I\u2019ll kick you down stairs!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not said right,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cNot quite right, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Alice, timidly; \u201csome of the words have got altered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is wrong from beginning to end,\u201d said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.\n\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n\n\u201cWhat size do you want to be?\u201d it asked.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not particular as to size,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201conly one doesn\u2019t like changing so often, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n\n\u201cAre you content now?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d said Alice: \u201cthree inches is such a wretched height to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a very good height indeed!\u201d said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not used to it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, \u201cI wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily offended!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u201d said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, \u201cOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne side of what? The other side of what?\u201d thought Alice to herself.\n\n\u201cOf the mushroom,\u201d said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n\n\u201cAnd now which is which?\u201d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.\n\n\u201cCome, my head\u2019s free at last!\u201d said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n\n\u201cWhat can all that green stuff be?\u201d said Alice. \u201cAnd where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\u2019t see you?\u201d She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n\n\u201cSerpent!\u201d screamed the Pigeon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a serpent!\u201d said Alice indignantly. \u201cLet me alone!\u201d\n\n\u201cSerpent, I say again!\u201d repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, \u201cI\u2019ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the least idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Alice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried the roots of trees, and I\u2019ve tried banks, and I\u2019ve tried hedges,\u201d the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \u201cbut those serpents! There\u2019s no pleasing them!\u201d\n\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\n\u201cAs if it wasn\u2019t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut I must be on the lookout for serpents night and day! Why, I haven\u2019t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve been annoyed,\u201d said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.\n\n\u201cAnd just as I\u2019d taken the highest tree in the wood,\u201d continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \u201cand just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not a serpent, I tell you!\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019m a\u2060\u2014I\u2019m a\u2060\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell! What are you?\u201d said the Pigeon. \u201cI can see you\u2019re trying to invent something!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2060\u2014I\u2019m a little girl,\u201d said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\n\u201cA likely story indeed!\u201d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You\u2019re a serpent; and there\u2019s no use denying it. I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have tasted eggs, certainly,\u201d said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \u201cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut if they do, why then they\u2019re a kind of serpent, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters a good deal to me,\u201d said Alice hastily; \u201cbut I\u2019m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\u2019t want yours: I don\u2019t like them raw.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, be off, then!\u201d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. \u201cCome, there\u2019s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m never sure what I\u2019m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I\u2019ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2060\u2014how is that to be done, I wonder?\u201d As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \u201cWhoever lives there,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cit\u2019ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\u201d So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",

The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?\u201d Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen\u2060\u2014everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.\n\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \u201cWhy, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u201d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.\n\n\u201cHe took me for his housemaid,\u201d she said to herself as she ran. \u201cHow surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves\u2060\u2014that is, if I can find them.\u201d As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u201cW. Rabbit\u201d engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\n\n\u201cHow queer it seems,\u201d Alice said to herself, \u201cto be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201d And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u201c\u200a\u2018Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019 \u2018Coming in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I don\u2019t think,\u201d Alice went on, \u201cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u201d\n\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \u201cDrink Me,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u201cI know something interesting is sure to happen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201d\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough\u2060\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t grow any more\u2060\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door\u2060\u2014I do wish I hadn\u2019t drunk quite so much!\u201d\n\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself, \u201cNow I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?\u201d\n\nA gigantic Alice is crammed inside a small room, her arm of the window.\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n\u201cIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cwhen one wasn\u2019t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole\u2060\u2014and yet\u2060\u2014and yet\u2060\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairytales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2060\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201d she added in a sorrowful tone; \u201cat least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more here.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cshall I never get any older than I am now? That\u2019ll be a comfort, one way\u2060\u2014never to be an old woman\u2060\u2014but then\u2060\u2014always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like that!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you foolish Alice!\u201d she answered herself. \u201cHow can you learn lessons in here? Why, there\u2019s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!\u201d\n\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n\n\u201cMary Ann! Mary Ann!\u201d said the voice. \u201cFetch me my gloves this moment!\u201d Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \u201cThen I\u2019ll go round and get in at the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you won\u2019t!\u201d thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n\nAlice\u2019s giant hand comes down from above. A white rabbit in a waistcoat has fallen back into a cucumber-frame.\nNext came an angry voice\u2060\u2014the Rabbit\u2019s\u2060\u2014\u201cPat! Pat! Where are you?\u201d And then a voice she had never heard before, \u201cSure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u201d\n\n\u201cDigging for apples, indeed!\u201d said the Rabbit angrily. \u201cHere! Come and help me out of this!\u201d (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\n\u201cNow tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u201d (He pronounced it \u201carrum.\u201d)\n\n\u201cAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \u201cSure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u201d \u201cDo as I tell you, you coward!\u201d and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u201cWhat a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u201d\n\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u201cWhere\u2019s the other ladder?\u2060\u2014Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other\u2060\u2014Bill! fetch it here, lad!\u2060\u2014Here, put \u2019em up at this corner\u2060\u2014No, tie \u2019em together first\u2060\u2014they don\u2019t reach half high enough yet\u2060\u2014Oh! they\u2019ll do well enough; don\u2019t be particular\u2060\u2014Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope\u2060\u2014Will the roof bear?\u2060\u2014Mind that loose slate\u2060\u2014Oh, it\u2019s coming down! Heads below!\u201d (a loud crash)\u2060\u2014\u201cNow, who did that?\u2060\u2014It was Bill, I fancy\u2060\u2014Who\u2019s to go down the chimney?\u2060\u2014Nay, I shan\u2019t! You do it!\u2060\u2014That I won\u2019t, then!\u2060\u2014Bill\u2019s to go down\u2060\u2014Here, Bill! the master says you\u2019re to go down the chimney!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! So Bill\u2019s got to come down the chimney, has he?\u201d said Alice to herself. \u201cShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\u2019t be in Bill\u2019s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!\u201d\n\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn\u2019t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \u201cThis is Bill,\u201d she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\n\nA lizard is being shot upwards out of a smoking chimney.\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \u201cThere goes Bill!\u201d then the Rabbit\u2019s voice along\u2060\u2014\u201cCatch him, you by the hedge!\u201d then silence, and then another confusion of voices\u2060\u2014\u201cHold up his head\u2060\u2014Brandy now\u2060\u2014Don\u2019t choke him\u2060\u2014How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!\u201d\n\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\u201cThat\u2019s Bill,\u201d thought Alice,) \u201cWell, I hardly know\u2060\u2014No more, thank ye; I\u2019m better now\u2060\u2014but I\u2019m a deal too flustered to tell you\u2060\u2014all I know is, something comes at me like a jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a skyrocket!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you did, old fellow!\u201d said the others.\n\n\u201cWe must burn the house down!\u201d said the Rabbit\u2019s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, \u201cIf you do. I\u2019ll set Dinah at you!\u201d\n\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \u201cI wonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they\u2019d take the roof off.\u201d After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \u201cA barrowful will do, to begin with.\u201d\n\n\u201cA barrowful of what?\u201d thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. \u201cI\u2019ll put a stop to this,\u201d she said to herself, and shouted out, \u201cYou\u2019d better not do that again!\u201d which produced another dead silence.\n\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. \u201cIf I eat one of these cakes,\u201d she thought, \u201cit\u2019s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can\u2019t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.\u201d\n\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u201cis to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\u201d\n\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.\n\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little thing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\n\nA tiny Alice hesitantly proffers a stick to a puppy dog which is far larger than herself.\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n\n\u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \u201cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2060\u2014if I\u2019d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\u2019d nearly forgotten that I\u2019ve got to grow up again! Let me see\u2060\u2014how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?\u201d\n\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\n\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.",

were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank\u2060\u2014the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am older than you, and must know better\u201d; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\u2019ll soon make you dry enough!\u201d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n\n\u201cAhem!\u201d said the Mouse with an important air, \u201care you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \u2018William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh!\u201d said the Lory, with a shiver.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u201cDid you speak?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot I!\u201d said the Lory hastily.\n\n\u201cI thought you did,\u201d said the Mouse. \u201c\u2060\u2014I proceed. \u2018Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\u201cFound what?\u201d said the Duck.\n\n\u201cFound it,\u201d the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u201cof course you know what \u2018it\u2019 means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what \u2018it\u2019 means well enough, when I find a thing,\u201d said the Duck: \u201cit\u2019s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\u201d\n\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u201c\u200a\u2018\u2060\u2014found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William\u2019s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans\u2060\u2014\u2019 How are you getting on now, my dear?\u201d it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.\n\n\u201cAs wet as ever,\u201d said Alice in a melancholy tone: \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to dry me at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u201cI move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies\u2060\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak English!\u201d said the Eaglet. \u201cI don\u2019t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t believe you do either!\u201d And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.\n\n\u201cWhat I was going to say,\u201d said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u201cwas, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a Caucus-race?\u201d said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said the Dodo, \u201cthe best way to explain it is to do it.\u201d (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n\nFirst it marked out a racecourse, in a sort of circle, (\u201cthe exact shape doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and away,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, \u201ceverybody has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\n\u201cWhy, she, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \u201cPrizes! Prizes!\u201d\n\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one apiece all round.\n\n\u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201cWhat else have you got in your pocket?\u201d he went on, turning to Alice.\n\n\u201cOnly a thimble,\u201d said Alice sadly.\n\n\u201cHand it over here,\u201d said the Dodo.\n\nAlice accepts a humble handed to her by a dodo who is taller than herself. The dodo leans upon a stick.\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble\u201d; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\n\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.\n\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\n\u201cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand why it is you hate\u2060\u2014C and D,\u201d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.\n\n\u201cMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.\n\n\u201cIt is a long tail, certainly,\u201d said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail; \u201cbut why do you call it sad?\u201d And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u2060\u2014\n\n\u201cFury said to\na mouse, That\nhe met\nin the\nhouse,\n\u2018Let us\nboth go\nto law:\nI will\nprosecute\nyou\u2060\u2014\nCome, I\u2019ll\ntake no\ndenial;\nWe must\nhave a\ntrial:\nFor\nreally\nthis\nmorning\nI\u2019ve\nnothing\nto do.\u2019\nSaid the\nmouse to\nthe cur,\n\u2018Such a\ntrial,\ndear Sir,\nWith no\njury or\njudge,\nwould be\nwasting\nour breath.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll be\njudge,\nI\u2019ll be\njury,\u2019\nSaid\ncunning\nold Fury:\n\u2018I\u2019ll try\nthe whole\ncause,\nand\ncondemn\nyou\nto\ndeath.\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\u201cYou are not attending!\u201d said the Mouse to Alice severely. \u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Alice very humbly: \u201cyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had not!\u201d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\n\u201cA knot!\u201d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. \u201cOh, do let me help to undo it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall do nothing of the sort,\u201d said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \u201cYou insult me by talking such nonsense!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice. \u201cBut you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u201d\n\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\n\n\u201cPlease come back and finish your story!\u201d Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \u201cYes, please do!\u201d but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n\n\u201cWhat a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u201d sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u201cAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, Ma!\u201d said the young Crab, a little snappishly. \u201cYou\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u201d said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. \u201cShe\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u201d said the Lory.\n\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u201cDinah\u2019s our cat. And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u201d\n\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \u201cI really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u201d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \u201cCome away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\u201d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\n\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u201d she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u201cNobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u201d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.",

Goodbye, feet!\u201d (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). \u201cOh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m sure I shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2060\u2014but I must be kind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\u201d\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201cThey must go by the carrier,\u201d she thought; \u201cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending presents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\nAlice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq.\nHearthrug,\nNear the Fender,\n(With Alice\u2019s Love).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like you,\u201d (she might well say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u201d But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\n\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of anyone; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please, sir\u2060\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice kneels in a low corridor, watching a white rabbit hurry away.\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear! How queer everything is today! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that\u2019s the great puzzle!\u201d And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u201d she said, \u201cfor her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she\u2019s she, and I\u2019m I, and\u2060\u2014oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2060\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t signify: let\u2019s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome\u2060\u2014no, that\u2019s all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u2018How doth the little\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:\u2060\u2014\n\n\u201cHow doth the little crocodile\nImprove his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\nOn every golden scale!\n\n\u201cHow cheerfully he seems to grin,\nHow neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\nWith gently smiling jaws!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u201d said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \u201cI must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve made up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019 I shall only look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down here till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019\u2060\u2014but, oh dear!\u201d cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \u201cI do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!\u201d\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking. \u201cHow can I have done that?\u201d she thought. \u201cI must be growing small again.\u201d She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n\u201cThat was a narrow escape!\u201d said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u201cand now for the garden!\u201d and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \u201cand things are worse than ever,\u201d thought the poor child, \u201cfor I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u201d\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \u201cand in that case I can go back by railway,\u201d she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\n\nAlice is swept off her feet by a flood of water which reaches over her shoulders.\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201d said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. \u201cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer today.\u201d\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\n\n\u201cWould it be of any use, now,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cto speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201d So she began: \u201cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201d (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201cA mouse\u2060\u2014of a mouse\u2060\u2014to a mouse\u2060\u2014a mouse\u2060\u2014O mouse!\u201d The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI daresay it\u2019s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201d (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \u201cOu est ma chatte?\u201d which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201cI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot like cats!\u201d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201cWould you like cats if you were me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps not,\u201d said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201cdon\u2019t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,\u201d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \u201cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face\u2060\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse\u2060\u2014and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice\u2060\u2014oh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk about her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe indeed!\u201d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. \u201cAs if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u2019t let me hear the name again!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t indeed!\u201d said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \u201cAre you\u2060\u2014are you fond\u2060\u2014of\u2060\u2014of dogs?\u201d The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \u201cThere is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things\u2060\u2014I can\u2019t remember half of them\u2060\u2014and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and\u2060\u2014oh dear!\u201d cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u201d For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\n\nAlice is swimming in a pool watching a mouse as big as herself swim away.\nSo she called softly after it, \u201cMouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u201d When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u201cLet us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u201d\n\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",

was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice \u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u201cOrange Marmalade,\u201d but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! \u201cI wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\u2060\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201c\u2060\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2060\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2060\u2014\u201d (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u201c\u2060\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2060\u2014fancy curtseying as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201cAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much tonight, I should think!\u201d (Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at teatime. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201cDrink Me\u201d beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n\nIt was all very well to say \u201cDrink me,\u201d but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll look first,\u201d she said, \u201cand see whether it\u2019s marked \u2018poison\u2019 or not\u201d; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \u201cpoison,\u201d it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was not marked \u201cpoison,\u201d so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n\n\u201cWhat a curious feeling!\u201d said Alice; \u201cI must be shutting up like a telescope.\u201d\n\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u201cfor it might end, you know,\u201d said Alice to herself, \u201cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u201d And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n\n\u201cCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201d said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u201cI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201d She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u201cBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cto pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!\u201d\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u201cEat Me\u201d were beautifully marked in currants. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201d\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201cWhich way? Which way?\u201d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",

Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, \u201cI\u2060\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2060\u2014at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said the Caterpillar sternly. \u201cExplain yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain myself, I\u2019m afraid, sir,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not myself, you see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u201d Alice replied very politely, \u201cfor I can\u2019t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u201d said Alice; \u201cbut when you have to turn into a chrysalis\u2060\u2014you will some day, you know\u2060\u2014and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little queer, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u201d said Alice; \u201call I know is, it would feel very queer to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u201cI think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\n\n\u201cCome back!\u201d the Caterpillar called after her. \u201cI\u2019ve something important to say!\u201d\n\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n\n\u201cKeep your temper,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \u201cSo you think you\u2019re changed, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I am, sir,\u201d said Alice; \u201cI can\u2019t remember things as I used\u2060\u2014and I don\u2019t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t remember what things?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve tried to say \u2018How doth the little busy bee,\u2019 but it all came different!\u201d Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n\n\u201cRepeat, \u2018you are old, Father William,\u2019\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice folded her hands, and began:\u2060\u2014\n\nA young man in rural costume stares at an old fat man who is standing on his head.\n\u201cYou are old, Father William,\u201d the young man said,\n\u201cAnd your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2060\u2014\nDo you think, at your age, it is right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d Father William replied to his son,\n\u201cI feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I\u2019m perfectly sure I have none,\nWhy, I do it again and again.\u201d\n\nA young man in rural costume backs away from a doorway as an old fat man somersaults through it.\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cas I mentioned before,\nand have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door\u2060\u2014\nPray, what is the reason of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n\u201cI kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment\u2060\u2014one shilling the box\u2060\u2014\nAllow me to sell you a couple?\u201d\n\nA young man in rural costume lifts the covers from a empty plates and stares at a fat old man sitting by a fireplace.\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cand your jaws are too weak\nFor anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2060\u2014\nPray how did you manage to do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d said his father, \u201cI took to the law,\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\nHas lasted the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nA young man in rural costume stares in amazement at an old fat man who is balancing a wriggling eel on his nose.\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cone would hardly suppose\nThat your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2060\u2014\nWhat made you so awfully clever?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\u201d\nSaid his father; \u201cdon\u2019t give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\nBe off, or I\u2019ll kick you down stairs!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not said right,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cNot quite right, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Alice, timidly; \u201csome of the words have got altered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is wrong from beginning to end,\u201d said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.\n\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n\n\u201cWhat size do you want to be?\u201d it asked.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not particular as to size,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201conly one doesn\u2019t like changing so often, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n\n\u201cAre you content now?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d said Alice: \u201cthree inches is such a wretched height to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a very good height indeed!\u201d said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not used to it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, \u201cI wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily offended!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u201d said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, \u201cOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne side of what? The other side of what?\u201d thought Alice to herself.\n\n\u201cOf the mushroom,\u201d said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n\n\u201cAnd now which is which?\u201d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.\n\n\u201cCome, my head\u2019s free at last!\u201d said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n\n\u201cWhat can all that green stuff be?\u201d said Alice. \u201cAnd where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\u2019t see you?\u201d She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n\n\u201cSerpent!\u201d screamed the Pigeon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a serpent!\u201d said Alice indignantly. \u201cLet me alone!\u201d\n\n\u201cSerpent, I say again!\u201d repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, \u201cI\u2019ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the least idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Alice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried the roots of trees, and I\u2019ve tried banks, and I\u2019ve tried hedges,\u201d the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \u201cbut those serpents! There\u2019s no pleasing them!\u201d\n\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\n\u201cAs if it wasn\u2019t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut I must be on the lookout for serpents night and day! Why, I haven\u2019t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve been annoyed,\u201d said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.\n\n\u201cAnd just as I\u2019d taken the highest tree in the wood,\u201d continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \u201cand just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not a serpent, I tell you!\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019m a\u2060\u2014I\u2019m a\u2060\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell! What are you?\u201d said the Pigeon. \u201cI can see you\u2019re trying to invent something!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2060\u2014I\u2019m a little girl,\u201d said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\n\u201cA likely story indeed!\u201d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You\u2019re a serpent; and there\u2019s no use denying it. I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have tasted eggs, certainly,\u201d said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \u201cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut if they do, why then they\u2019re a kind of serpent, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters a good deal to me,\u201d said Alice hastily; \u201cbut I\u2019m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\u2019t want yours: I don\u2019t like them raw.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, be off, then!\u201d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. \u201cCome, there\u2019s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m never sure what I\u2019m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I\u2019ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2060\u2014how is that to be done, I wonder?\u201d As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \u201cWhoever lives there,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cit\u2019ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\u201d So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",

The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?\u201d Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen\u2060\u2014everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.\n\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \u201cWhy, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u201d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.\n\n\u201cHe took me for his housemaid,\u201d she said to herself as she ran. \u201cHow surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves\u2060\u2014that is, if I can find them.\u201d As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u201cW. Rabbit\u201d engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\n\n\u201cHow queer it seems,\u201d Alice said to herself, \u201cto be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201d And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u201c\u200a\u2018Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019 \u2018Coming in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I don\u2019t think,\u201d Alice went on, \u201cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u201d\n\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \u201cDrink Me,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u201cI know something interesting is sure to happen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201d\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough\u2060\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t grow any more\u2060\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door\u2060\u2014I do wish I hadn\u2019t drunk quite so much!\u201d\n\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself, \u201cNow I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?\u201d\n\nA gigantic Alice is crammed inside a small room, her arm of the window.\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n\u201cIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cwhen one wasn\u2019t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole\u2060\u2014and yet\u2060\u2014and yet\u2060\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairytales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2060\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201d she added in a sorrowful tone; \u201cat least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more here.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cshall I never get any older than I am now? That\u2019ll be a comfort, one way\u2060\u2014never to be an old woman\u2060\u2014but then\u2060\u2014always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like that!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you foolish Alice!\u201d she answered herself. \u201cHow can you learn lessons in here? Why, there\u2019s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!\u201d\n\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n\n\u201cMary Ann! Mary Ann!\u201d said the voice. \u201cFetch me my gloves this moment!\u201d Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \u201cThen I\u2019ll go round and get in at the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you won\u2019t!\u201d thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n\nAlice\u2019s giant hand comes down from above. A white rabbit in a waistcoat has fallen back into a cucumber-frame.\nNext came an angry voice\u2060\u2014the Rabbit\u2019s\u2060\u2014\u201cPat! Pat! Where are you?\u201d And then a voice she had never heard before, \u201cSure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u201d\n\n\u201cDigging for apples, indeed!\u201d said the Rabbit angrily. \u201cHere! Come and help me out of this!\u201d (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\n\u201cNow tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u201d (He pronounced it \u201carrum.\u201d)\n\n\u201cAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \u201cSure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u201d \u201cDo as I tell you, you coward!\u201d and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u201cWhat a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u201d\n\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u201cWhere\u2019s the other ladder?\u2060\u2014Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other\u2060\u2014Bill! fetch it here, lad!\u2060\u2014Here, put \u2019em up at this corner\u2060\u2014No, tie \u2019em together first\u2060\u2014they don\u2019t reach half high enough yet\u2060\u2014Oh! they\u2019ll do well enough; don\u2019t be particular\u2060\u2014Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope\u2060\u2014Will the roof bear?\u2060\u2014Mind that loose slate\u2060\u2014Oh, it\u2019s coming down! Heads below!\u201d (a loud crash)\u2060\u2014\u201cNow, who did that?\u2060\u2014It was Bill, I fancy\u2060\u2014Who\u2019s to go down the chimney?\u2060\u2014Nay, I shan\u2019t! You do it!\u2060\u2014That I won\u2019t, then!\u2060\u2014Bill\u2019s to go down\u2060\u2014Here, Bill! the master says you\u2019re to go down the chimney!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! So Bill\u2019s got to come down the chimney, has he?\u201d said Alice to herself. \u201cShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\u2019t be in Bill\u2019s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!\u201d\n\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn\u2019t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \u201cThis is Bill,\u201d she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\n\nA lizard is being shot upwards out of a smoking chimney.\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \u201cThere goes Bill!\u201d then the Rabbit\u2019s voice along\u2060\u2014\u201cCatch him, you by the hedge!\u201d then silence, and then another confusion of voices\u2060\u2014\u201cHold up his head\u2060\u2014Brandy now\u2060\u2014Don\u2019t choke him\u2060\u2014How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!\u201d\n\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\u201cThat\u2019s Bill,\u201d thought Alice,) \u201cWell, I hardly know\u2060\u2014No more, thank ye; I\u2019m better now\u2060\u2014but I\u2019m a deal too flustered to tell you\u2060\u2014all I know is, something comes at me like a jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a skyrocket!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you did, old fellow!\u201d said the others.\n\n\u201cWe must burn the house down!\u201d said the Rabbit\u2019s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, \u201cIf you do. I\u2019ll set Dinah at you!\u201d\n\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \u201cI wonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they\u2019d take the roof off.\u201d After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \u201cA barrowful will do, to begin with.\u201d\n\n\u201cA barrowful of what?\u201d thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. \u201cI\u2019ll put a stop to this,\u201d she said to herself, and shouted out, \u201cYou\u2019d better not do that again!\u201d which produced another dead silence.\n\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. \u201cIf I eat one of these cakes,\u201d she thought, \u201cit\u2019s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can\u2019t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.\u201d\n\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u201cis to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\u201d\n\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.\n\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little thing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\n\nA tiny Alice hesitantly proffers a stick to a puppy dog which is far larger than herself.\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n\n\u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \u201cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2060\u2014if I\u2019d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\u2019d nearly forgotten that I\u2019ve got to grow up again! Let me see\u2060\u2014how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?\u201d\n\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\n\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.",

were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank\u2060\u2014the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am older than you, and must know better\u201d; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\u2019ll soon make you dry enough!\u201d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n\n\u201cAhem!\u201d said the Mouse with an important air, \u201care you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \u2018William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh!\u201d said the Lory, with a shiver.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u201cDid you speak?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot I!\u201d said the Lory hastily.\n\n\u201cI thought you did,\u201d said the Mouse. \u201c\u2060\u2014I proceed. \u2018Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\u201cFound what?\u201d said the Duck.\n\n\u201cFound it,\u201d the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u201cof course you know what \u2018it\u2019 means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what \u2018it\u2019 means well enough, when I find a thing,\u201d said the Duck: \u201cit\u2019s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\u201d\n\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u201c\u200a\u2018\u2060\u2014found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William\u2019s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans\u2060\u2014\u2019 How are you getting on now, my dear?\u201d it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.\n\n\u201cAs wet as ever,\u201d said Alice in a melancholy tone: \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to dry me at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u201cI move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies\u2060\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak English!\u201d said the Eaglet. \u201cI don\u2019t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t believe you do either!\u201d And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.\n\n\u201cWhat I was going to say,\u201d said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u201cwas, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a Caucus-race?\u201d said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said the Dodo, \u201cthe best way to explain it is to do it.\u201d (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n\nFirst it marked out a racecourse, in a sort of circle, (\u201cthe exact shape doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and away,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, \u201ceverybody has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\n\u201cWhy, she, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \u201cPrizes! Prizes!\u201d\n\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one apiece all round.\n\n\u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201cWhat else have you got in your pocket?\u201d he went on, turning to Alice.\n\n\u201cOnly a thimble,\u201d said Alice sadly.\n\n\u201cHand it over here,\u201d said the Dodo.\n\nAlice accepts a humble handed to her by a dodo who is taller than herself. The dodo leans upon a stick.\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble\u201d; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\n\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.\n\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\n\u201cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand why it is you hate\u2060\u2014C and D,\u201d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.\n\n\u201cMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.\n\n\u201cIt is a long tail, certainly,\u201d said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail; \u201cbut why do you call it sad?\u201d And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u2060\u2014\n\n\u201cFury said to\na mouse, That\nhe met\nin the\nhouse,\n\u2018Let us\nboth go\nto law:\nI will\nprosecute\nyou\u2060\u2014\nCome, I\u2019ll\ntake no\ndenial;\nWe must\nhave a\ntrial:\nFor\nreally\nthis\nmorning\nI\u2019ve\nnothing\nto do.\u2019\nSaid the\nmouse to\nthe cur,\n\u2018Such a\ntrial,\ndear Sir,\nWith no\njury or\njudge,\nwould be\nwasting\nour breath.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll be\njudge,\nI\u2019ll be\njury,\u2019\nSaid\ncunning\nold Fury:\n\u2018I\u2019ll try\nthe whole\ncause,\nand\ncondemn\nyou\nto\ndeath.\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\u201cYou are not attending!\u201d said the Mouse to Alice severely. \u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Alice very humbly: \u201cyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had not!\u201d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\n\u201cA knot!\u201d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. \u201cOh, do let me help to undo it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall do nothing of the sort,\u201d said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \u201cYou insult me by talking such nonsense!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice. \u201cBut you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u201d\n\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\n\n\u201cPlease come back and finish your story!\u201d Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \u201cYes, please do!\u201d but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n\n\u201cWhat a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u201d sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u201cAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, Ma!\u201d said the young Crab, a little snappishly. \u201cYou\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u201d said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. \u201cShe\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u201d said the Lory.\n\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u201cDinah\u2019s our cat. And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u201d\n\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \u201cI really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u201d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \u201cCome away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\u201d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\n\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u201d she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u201cNobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u201d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story.",

Goodbye, feet!\u201d (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off). \u201cOh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I\u2019m sure I shan\u2019t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;\u2060\u2014but I must be kind to them,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cor perhaps they won\u2019t walk the way I want to go! Let me see: I\u2019ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.\u201d\n\nAnd she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. \u201cThey must go by the carrier,\u201d she thought; \u201cand how funny it\u2019ll seem, sending presents to one\u2019s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!\n\nAlice\u2019s Right Foot, Esq.\nHearthrug,\nNear the Fender,\n(With Alice\u2019s Love).\n\nOh dear, what nonsense I\u2019m talking!\u201d\n\nJust then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\n\nPoor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she sat down and began to cry again.\n\n\u201cYou ought to be ashamed of yourself,\u201d said Alice, \u201ca great girl like you,\u201d (she might well say this), \u201cto go on crying in this way! Stop this moment, I tell you!\u201d But she went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.\n\nAfter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he came, \u201cOh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won\u2019t she be savage if I\u2019ve kept her waiting!\u201d Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of anyone; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, \u201cIf you please, sir\u2060\u2014\u201d The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go.\n\nAlice kneels in a low corridor, watching a white rabbit hurry away.\nAlice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking: \u201cDear, dear! How queer everything is today! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I\u2019ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I\u2019m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah, that\u2019s the great puzzle!\u201d And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019m not Ada,\u201d she said, \u201cfor her hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn\u2019t go in ringlets at all; and I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she\u2019s she, and I\u2019m I, and\u2060\u2014oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I\u2019ll try if I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is\u2060\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn\u2019t signify: let\u2019s try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome\u2060\u2014no, that\u2019s all wrong, I\u2019m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I\u2019ll try and say \u2018How doth the little\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:\u2060\u2014\n\n\u201cHow doth the little crocodile\nImprove his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\nOn every golden scale!\n\n\u201cHow cheerfully he seems to grin,\nHow neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\nWith gently smiling jaws!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure those are not the right words,\u201d said poor Alice, and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, \u201cI must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I\u2019ve made up my mind about it; if I\u2019m Mabel, I\u2019ll stay down here! It\u2019ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \u2018Come up again, dear!\u2019 I shall only look up and say \u2018Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I\u2019ll come up: if not, I\u2019ll stay down here till I\u2019m somebody else\u2019\u2060\u2014but, oh dear!\u201d cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, \u201cI do wish they would put their heads down! I am so very tired of being all alone here!\u201d\n\nAs she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit\u2019s little white kid gloves while she was talking. \u201cHow can I have done that?\u201d she thought. \u201cI must be growing small again.\u201d She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.\n\n\u201cThat was a narrow escape!\u201d said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; \u201cand now for the garden!\u201d and she ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, \u201cand things are worse than ever,\u201d thought the poor child, \u201cfor I never was so small as this before, never! And I declare it\u2019s too bad, that it is!\u201d\n\nAs she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, \u201cand in that case I can go back by railway,\u201d she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high.\n\nAlice is swept off her feet by a flood of water which reaches over her shoulders.\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t cried so much!\u201d said Alice, as she swam about, trying to find her way out. \u201cI shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer today.\u201d\n\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.\n\n\u201cWould it be of any use, now,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cto speak to this mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there\u2019s no harm in trying.\u201d So she began: \u201cO Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!\u201d (Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having seen in her brother\u2019s Latin Grammar, \u201cA mouse\u2060\u2014of a mouse\u2060\u2014to a mouse\u2060\u2014a mouse\u2060\u2014O mouse!\u201d The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.\n\n\u201cPerhaps it doesn\u2019t understand English,\u201d thought Alice; \u201cI daresay it\u2019s a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\u201d (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: \u201cOu est ma chatte?\u201d which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. \u201cOh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the poor animal\u2019s feelings. \u201cI quite forgot you didn\u2019t like cats.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot like cats!\u201d cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \u201cWould you like cats if you were me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps not,\u201d said Alice in a soothing tone: \u201cdon\u2019t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you\u2019d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear quiet thing,\u201d Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the pool, \u201cand she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face\u2060\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse\u2060\u2014and she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice\u2060\u2014oh, I beg your pardon!\u201d cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \u201cWe won\u2019t talk about her any more if you\u2019d rather not.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe indeed!\u201d cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his tail. \u201cAs if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don\u2019t let me hear the name again!\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t indeed!\u201d said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. \u201cAre you\u2060\u2014are you fond\u2060\u2014of\u2060\u2014of dogs?\u201d The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: \u201cThere is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it\u2019ll fetch things when you throw them, and it\u2019ll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things\u2060\u2014I can\u2019t remember half of them\u2060\u2014and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it\u2019s so useful, it\u2019s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the rats and\u2060\u2014oh dear!\u201d cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve offended it again!\u201d For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\n\nAlice is swimming in a pool watching a mouse as big as herself swim away.\nSo she called softly after it, \u201cMouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u201d When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u201cLet us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u201d\n\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.",

was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice \u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d\n\nSo she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.\n\nThere was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u201cOh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u201d (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.\n\nIn another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.\n\nThe rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.\n\nEither the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u201cOrange Marmalade,\u201d but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d thought Alice to herself, \u201cafter such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u201d (Which was very likely true.)\n\nDown, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! \u201cI wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think\u2060\u2014\u201d (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u201c\u2060\u2014yes, that\u2019s about the right distance\u2060\u2014but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u201d (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)\n\nPresently she began again. \u201cI wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2060\u2014\u201d (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u201c\u2060\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u201d (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2060\u2014fancy curtseying as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u201cAnd what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u201d\n\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u201cDinah\u2019ll miss me very much tonight, I should think!\u201d (Dinah was the cat.) \u201cI hope they\u2019ll remember her saucer of milk at teatime. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I\u2019m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that\u2019s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\u201d And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, \u201cDo cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\u201d and sometimes, \u201cDo bats eat cats?\u201d for, you see, as she couldn\u2019t answer either question, it didn\u2019t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u201cNow, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u201d when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n\nAlice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u201cOh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u201d She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.\n\nThere were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n\nSuddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n\nAlice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u201cand even if my head would go through,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cit would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.\u201d For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.\n\nThere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (\u201cwhich certainly was not here before,\u201d said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words \u201cDrink Me\u201d beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n\nIt was all very well to say \u201cDrink me,\u201d but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. \u201cNo, I\u2019ll look first,\u201d she said, \u201cand see whether it\u2019s marked \u2018poison\u2019 or not\u201d; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked \u201cpoison,\u201d it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.\n\nHowever, this bottle was not marked \u201cpoison,\u201d so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pineapple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.\n\n\u201cWhat a curious feeling!\u201d said Alice; \u201cI must be shutting up like a telescope.\u201d\n\nAnd so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u201cfor it might end, you know,\u201d said Alice to herself, \u201cin my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u201d And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.\n\nAfter a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\n\n\u201cCome, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u201d said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u201cI advise you to leave off this minute!\u201d She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. \u201cBut it\u2019s no use now,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cto pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!\u201d\n\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u201cEat Me\u201d were beautifully marked in currants. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll eat it,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u201d\n\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u201cWhich way? Which way?\u201d, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.\n\nSo she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",

Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, \u201cI\u2060\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2060\u2014at least I know who I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d said the Caterpillar sternly. \u201cExplain yourself!\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t explain myself, I\u2019m afraid, sir,\u201d said Alice, \u201cbecause I\u2019m not myself, you see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u201d Alice replied very politely, \u201cfor I can\u2019t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u201d said Alice; \u201cbut when you have to turn into a chrysalis\u2060\u2014you will some day, you know\u2060\u2014and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little queer, won\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u201d said Alice; \u201call I know is, it would feel very queer to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou!\u201d said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such very short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u201cI think, you ought to tell me who you are, first.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\n\n\u201cCome back!\u201d the Caterpillar called after her. \u201cI\u2019ve something important to say!\u201d\n\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n\n\u201cKeep your temper,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she could.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \u201cSo you think you\u2019re changed, do you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I am, sir,\u201d said Alice; \u201cI can\u2019t remember things as I used\u2060\u2014and I don\u2019t keep the same size for ten minutes together!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t remember what things?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ve tried to say \u2018How doth the little busy bee,\u2019 but it all came different!\u201d Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n\n\u201cRepeat, \u2018you are old, Father William,\u2019\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice folded her hands, and began:\u2060\u2014\n\nA young man in rural costume stares at an old fat man who is standing on his head.\n\u201cYou are old, Father William,\u201d the young man said,\n\u201cAnd your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2060\u2014\nDo you think, at your age, it is right?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d Father William replied to his son,\n\u201cI feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I\u2019m perfectly sure I have none,\nWhy, I do it again and again.\u201d\n\nA young man in rural costume backs away from a doorway as an old fat man somersaults through it.\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cas I mentioned before,\nand have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door\u2060\u2014\nPray, what is the reason of that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n\u201cI kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment\u2060\u2014one shilling the box\u2060\u2014\nAllow me to sell you a couple?\u201d\n\nA young man in rural costume lifts the covers from a empty plates and stares at a fat old man sitting by a fireplace.\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cand your jaws are too weak\nFor anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2060\u2014\nPray how did you manage to do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my youth,\u201d said his father, \u201cI took to the law,\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\nHas lasted the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nA young man in rural costume stares in amazement at an old fat man who is balancing a wriggling eel on his nose.\n\u201cYou are old,\u201d said the youth, \u201cone would hardly suppose\nThat your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2060\u2014\nWhat made you so awfully clever?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have answered three questions, and that is enough,\u201d\nSaid his father; \u201cdon\u2019t give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\nBe off, or I\u2019ll kick you down stairs!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not said right,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cNot quite right, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said Alice, timidly; \u201csome of the words have got altered.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is wrong from beginning to end,\u201d said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.\n\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n\n\u201cWhat size do you want to be?\u201d it asked.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m not particular as to size,\u201d Alice hastily replied; \u201conly one doesn\u2019t like changing so often, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n\n\u201cAre you content now?\u201d said the Caterpillar.\n\n\u201cWell, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if you wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d said Alice: \u201cthree inches is such a wretched height to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a very good height indeed!\u201d said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not used to it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, \u201cI wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily offended!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u201d said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, \u201cOne side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne side of what? The other side of what?\u201d thought Alice to herself.\n\n\u201cOf the mushroom,\u201d said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n\nAlice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n\n\u201cAnd now which is which?\u201d she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect. The next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\n\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the left-hand bit.\n\n\u201cCome, my head\u2019s free at last!\u201d said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n\n\u201cWhat can all that green stuff be?\u201d said Alice. \u201cAnd where have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can\u2019t see you?\u201d She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\n\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n\n\u201cSerpent!\u201d screamed the Pigeon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a serpent!\u201d said Alice indignantly. \u201cLet me alone!\u201d\n\n\u201cSerpent, I say again!\u201d repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, \u201cI\u2019ve tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t the least idea what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d said Alice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tried the roots of trees, and I\u2019ve tried banks, and I\u2019ve tried hedges,\u201d the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \u201cbut those serpents! There\u2019s no pleasing them!\u201d\n\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\n\u201cAs if it wasn\u2019t trouble enough hatching the eggs,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut I must be on the lookout for serpents night and day! Why, I haven\u2019t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very sorry you\u2019ve been annoyed,\u201d said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning.\n\n\u201cAnd just as I\u2019d taken the highest tree in the wood,\u201d continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \u201cand just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m not a serpent, I tell you!\u201d said Alice. \u201cI\u2019m a\u2060\u2014I\u2019m a\u2060\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWell! What are you?\u201d said the Pigeon. \u201cI can see you\u2019re trying to invent something!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2060\u2014I\u2019m a little girl,\u201d said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\n\u201cA likely story indeed!\u201d said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but never one with such a neck as that! No, no! You\u2019re a serpent; and there\u2019s no use denying it. I suppose you\u2019ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have tasted eggs, certainly,\u201d said Alice, who was a very truthful child; \u201cbut little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said the Pigeon; \u201cbut if they do, why then they\u2019re a kind of serpent, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d\n\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \u201cYou\u2019re looking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you\u2019re a little girl or a serpent?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt matters a good deal to me,\u201d said Alice hastily; \u201cbut I\u2019m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn\u2019t want yours: I don\u2019t like them raw.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, be off, then!\u201d said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. \u201cCome, there\u2019s half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I\u2019m never sure what I\u2019m going to be, from one minute to another! However, I\u2019ve got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2060\u2014how is that to be done, I wonder?\u201d As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. \u201cWhoever lives there,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cit\u2019ll never do to come upon them this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\u201d So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",

The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where can I have dropped them, I wonder?\u201d Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen\u2060\u2014everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.\n\nVery soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \u201cWhy, Mary Ann, what are you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u201d And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.\n\n\u201cHe took me for his housemaid,\u201d she said to herself as she ran. \u201cHow surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves\u2060\u2014that is, if I can find them.\u201d As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u201cW. Rabbit\u201d engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves.\n\n\u201cHow queer it seems,\u201d Alice said to herself, \u201cto be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u201d And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u201c\u200a\u2018Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u2019 \u2018Coming in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u2019 Only I don\u2019t think,\u201d Alice went on, \u201cthat they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u201d\n\nBy this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \u201cDrink Me,\u201d but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u201cI know something interesting is sure to happen,\u201d she said to herself, \u201cwhenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u201d\n\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough\u2060\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t grow any more\u2060\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the door\u2060\u2014I do wish I hadn\u2019t drunk quite so much!\u201d\n\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself, \u201cNow I can do no more, whatever happens. What will become of me?\u201d\n\nA gigantic Alice is crammed inside a small room, her arm of the window.\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n\n\u201cIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cwhen one wasn\u2019t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole\u2060\u2014and yet\u2060\u2014and yet\u2060\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! When I used to read fairytales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I\u2019ll write one\u2060\u2014but I\u2019m grown up now,\u201d she added in a sorrowful tone; \u201cat least there\u2019s no room to grow up any more here.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut then,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cshall I never get any older than I am now? That\u2019ll be a comfort, one way\u2060\u2014never to be an old woman\u2060\u2014but then\u2060\u2014always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn\u2019t like that!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you foolish Alice!\u201d she answered herself. \u201cHow can you learn lessons in here? Why, there\u2019s hardly room for you, and no room at all for any lesson-books!\u201d\n\nAnd so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.\n\n\u201cMary Ann! Mary Ann!\u201d said the voice. \u201cFetch me my gloves this moment!\u201d Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\n\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice\u2019s elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \u201cThen I\u2019ll go round and get in at the window.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat you won\u2019t!\u201d thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\n\nAlice\u2019s giant hand comes down from above. A white rabbit in a waistcoat has fallen back into a cucumber-frame.\nNext came an angry voice\u2060\u2014the Rabbit\u2019s\u2060\u2014\u201cPat! Pat! Where are you?\u201d And then a voice she had never heard before, \u201cSure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u201d\n\n\u201cDigging for apples, indeed!\u201d said the Rabbit angrily. \u201cHere! Come and help me out of this!\u201d (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\n\u201cNow tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u201d (He pronounced it \u201carrum.\u201d)\n\n\u201cAn arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u201d\n\n\u201cSure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u201d\n\nThere was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \u201cSure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u201d \u201cDo as I tell you, you coward!\u201d and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were two little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u201cWhat a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\u201d thought Alice. \u201cI wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they could! I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u201d\n\nShe waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u201cWhere\u2019s the other ladder?\u2060\u2014Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other\u2060\u2014Bill! fetch it here, lad!\u2060\u2014Here, put \u2019em up at this corner\u2060\u2014No, tie \u2019em together first\u2060\u2014they don\u2019t reach half high enough yet\u2060\u2014Oh! they\u2019ll do well enough; don\u2019t be particular\u2060\u2014Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope\u2060\u2014Will the roof bear?\u2060\u2014Mind that loose slate\u2060\u2014Oh, it\u2019s coming down! Heads below!\u201d (a loud crash)\u2060\u2014\u201cNow, who did that?\u2060\u2014It was Bill, I fancy\u2060\u2014Who\u2019s to go down the chimney?\u2060\u2014Nay, I shan\u2019t! You do it!\u2060\u2014That I won\u2019t, then!\u2060\u2014Bill\u2019s to go down\u2060\u2014Here, Bill! the master says you\u2019re to go down the chimney!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! So Bill\u2019s got to come down the chimney, has he?\u201d said Alice to herself. \u201cShy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! I wouldn\u2019t be in Bill\u2019s place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!\u201d\n\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn\u2019t guess of what sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself \u201cThis is Bill,\u201d she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\n\nA lizard is being shot upwards out of a smoking chimney.\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \u201cThere goes Bill!\u201d then the Rabbit\u2019s voice along\u2060\u2014\u201cCatch him, you by the hedge!\u201d then silence, and then another confusion of voices\u2060\u2014\u201cHold up his head\u2060\u2014Brandy now\u2060\u2014Don\u2019t choke him\u2060\u2014How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!\u201d\n\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\u201cThat\u2019s Bill,\u201d thought Alice,) \u201cWell, I hardly know\u2060\u2014No more, thank ye; I\u2019m better now\u2060\u2014but I\u2019m a deal too flustered to tell you\u2060\u2014all I know is, something comes at me like a jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a skyrocket!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you did, old fellow!\u201d said the others.\n\n\u201cWe must burn the house down!\u201d said the Rabbit\u2019s voice; and Alice called out as loud as she could, \u201cIf you do. I\u2019ll set Dinah at you!\u201d\n\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \u201cI wonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they\u2019d take the roof off.\u201d After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, \u201cA barrowful will do, to begin with.\u201d\n\n\u201cA barrowful of what?\u201d thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face. \u201cI\u2019ll put a stop to this,\u201d she said to herself, and shouted out, \u201cYou\u2019d better not do that again!\u201d which produced another dead silence.\n\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. \u201cIf I eat one of these cakes,\u201d she thought, \u201cit\u2019s sure to make some change in my size; and as it can\u2019t possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.\u201d\n\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u201d said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u201cis to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\u201d\n\nIt sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.\n\nAn enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u201cPoor little thing!\u201d said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\n\nA tiny Alice hesitantly proffers a stick to a puppy dog which is far larger than herself.\nHardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n\nThis seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy\u2019s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.\n\n\u201cAnd yet what a dear little puppy it was!\u201d said Alice, as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: \u201cI should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if\u2060\u2014if I\u2019d only been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I\u2019d nearly forgotten that I\u2019ve got to grow up again! Let me see\u2060\u2014how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?\u201d\n\nThe great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\n\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else.",

were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank\u2060\u2014the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.\n\nThe first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had known them all her life. Indeed, she had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, \u201cI am older than you, and must know better\u201d; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.\n\nAt last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, \u201cSit down, all of you, and listen to me! I\u2019ll soon make you dry enough!\u201d They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.\n\n\u201cAhem!\u201d said the Mouse with an important air, \u201care you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! \u2018William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh!\u201d said the Lory, with a shiver.\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon!\u201d said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: \u201cDid you speak?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot I!\u201d said the Lory hastily.\n\n\u201cI thought you did,\u201d said the Mouse. \u201c\u2060\u2014I proceed. \u2018Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him: and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable\u2060\u2014\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\n\u201cFound what?\u201d said the Duck.\n\n\u201cFound it,\u201d the Mouse replied rather crossly: \u201cof course you know what \u2018it\u2019 means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know what \u2018it\u2019 means well enough, when I find a thing,\u201d said the Duck: \u201cit\u2019s generally a frog or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?\u201d\n\nThe Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, \u201c\u200a\u2018\u2060\u2014found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown. William\u2019s conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his Normans\u2060\u2014\u2019 How are you getting on now, my dear?\u201d it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.\n\n\u201cAs wet as ever,\u201d said Alice in a melancholy tone: \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem to dry me at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case,\u201d said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, \u201cI move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies\u2060\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeak English!\u201d said the Eaglet. \u201cI don\u2019t know the meaning of half those long words, and, what\u2019s more, I don\u2019t believe you do either!\u201d And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly.\n\n\u201cWhat I was going to say,\u201d said the Dodo in an offended tone, \u201cwas, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a Caucus-race?\u201d said Alice; not that she wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d said the Dodo, \u201cthe best way to explain it is to do it.\u201d (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\n\nFirst it marked out a racecourse, in a sort of circle, (\u201cthe exact shape doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d it said,) and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there. There was no \u201cOne, two, three, and away,\u201d but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out \u201cThe race is over!\u201d and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, \u201cBut who has won?\u201d\n\nThis question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence. At last the Dodo said, \u201ceverybody has won, and all must have prizes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who is to give the prizes?\u201d quite a chorus of voices asked.\n\n\u201cWhy, she, of course,\u201d said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused way, \u201cPrizes! Prizes!\u201d\n\nAlice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one apiece all round.\n\n\u201cBut she must have a prize herself, you know,\u201d said the Mouse.\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d the Dodo replied very gravely. \u201cWhat else have you got in your pocket?\u201d he went on, turning to Alice.\n\n\u201cOnly a thimble,\u201d said Alice sadly.\n\n\u201cHand it over here,\u201d said the Dodo.\n\nAlice accepts a humble handed to her by a dodo who is taller than herself. The dodo leans upon a stick.\nThen they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying \u201cWe beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble\u201d; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.\n\nAlice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.\n\nThe next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.\n\n\u201cYou promised to tell me your history, you know,\u201d said Alice, \u201cand why it is you hate\u2060\u2014C and D,\u201d she added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again.\n\n\u201cMine is a long and a sad tale!\u201d said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing.\n\n\u201cIt is a long tail, certainly,\u201d said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse\u2019s tail; \u201cbut why do you call it sad?\u201d And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her idea of the tale was something like this:\u2060\u2014\n\n\u201cFury said to\na mouse, That\nhe met\nin the\nhouse,\n\u2018Let us\nboth go\nto law:\nI will\nprosecute\nyou\u2060\u2014\nCome, I\u2019ll\ntake no\ndenial;\nWe must\nhave a\ntrial:\nFor\nreally\nthis\nmorning\nI\u2019ve\nnothing\nto do.\u2019\nSaid the\nmouse to\nthe cur,\n\u2018Such a\ntrial,\ndear Sir,\nWith no\njury or\njudge,\nwould be\nwasting\nour breath.\u2019\n\u2018I\u2019ll be\njudge,\nI\u2019ll be\njury,\u2019\nSaid\ncunning\nold Fury:\n\u2018I\u2019ll try\nthe whole\ncause,\nand\ncondemn\nyou\nto\ndeath.\u2019\u200a\u201d\n\u201cYou are not attending!\u201d said the Mouse to Alice severely. \u201cWhat are you thinking of?\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d said Alice very humbly: \u201cyou had got to the fifth bend, I think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI had not!\u201d cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.\n\n\u201cA knot!\u201d said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her. \u201cOh, do let me help to undo it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall do nothing of the sort,\u201d said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. \u201cYou insult me by talking such nonsense!\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it!\u201d pleaded poor Alice. \u201cBut you\u2019re so easily offended, you know!\u201d\n\nThe Mouse only growled in reply.\n\n\u201cPlease come back and finish your story!\u201d Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, \u201cYes, please do!\u201d but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.\n\n\u201cWhat a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u201d sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u201cAh, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper!\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, Ma!\u201d said the young Crab, a little snappishly. \u201cYou\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u201d said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. \u201cShe\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u201d said the Lory.\n\nAlice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u201cDinah\u2019s our cat. And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u201d\n\nThis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \u201cI really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u201d and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \u201cCome away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\u201d On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.\n\n\u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u201d she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u201cNobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u201d And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story."
